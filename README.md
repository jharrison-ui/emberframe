## Why Emberframe

Adobe stopped developing Fireworks in 2013, and many designers still miss how it mixed vector shapes, bitmap editing, states and web export in one window. Emberframe brings that way of working back as a native Rust app you can read, build and change.

It is deliberately a look-alike: the same docked layout, tool groups, panels and light gray interface, under its own name and with every icon newly drawn. It contains no Adobe code or artwork.

## Get started

Download `emberframe.exe` for Windows from the [latest release](https://github.com/gregstein/emberframe/releases/latest) and run it.

> **Note:** If pre-built binaries are not yet published for your release, please build from source using the instructions below.

### Build from source

To build from source, you need Rust 1.91 or later, the Visual Studio C++ build tools, and the Windows SDK.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gregstein/emberframe.git
cd emberframe
cargo run --release
```

Then open [`examples/solstice-landing.ember`](examples/solstice-landing.ember) with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> to explore the design shown in the screenshots. The [user guide](docs/guide.md) explains the available tools and panels.

To execute tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Not in this version

Emberframe is at version 0.1, so some features are not yet implemented:

- Free rotation, Skew, and Distort. Rotate turns objects by 90 degrees and skips text and symbols.
- Bezier curves. Pen paths currently use straight segments.
- Masks, live effects in Styles, and moving selected pixels in place.
- Dragging Auto Shapes and library items onto the canvas (click them to insert).
- Printing, layer blend modes, and JPEG Selective quality and Smoothing (currently greyed out).
- Layers inside Fireworks PNG files (only the flattened image is read).
- macOS and Linux native builds.

Issues and pull requests are welcome, especially for the items listed above.
